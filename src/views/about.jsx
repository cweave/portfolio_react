        <p>I’m a front-end engineer and passionate user experience advocate with a knack for crafting intuitive, accessible, and visually engaging web applications. Currently, I work as a software engineer in the SaaS industry, where I specialize in building scalable, user-focused solutions.</p>

        <p>With deep expertise in semantic HTML, SCSS, React, Express, and vanilla JavaScript, I thrive on creating clean, efficient code and seamless user interfaces. By day, you’ll find me coding away on my rainbow-lit mechanical keyboard, turning ideas into functional, pixel-perfect designs.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I immerse myself in sci-fi and mystery novels, enjoy unraveling the twists of psychological thrillers, and dive into Azeroth as a high-level player in World of Warcraft. Whether it’s solving puzzles in code or conquering virtual challenges, I’m always up for a new adventure.</p>

        <p>Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
